# MATTER.js Implementation of Matter hub with express.js

I dont know shit about matter.js but I am trying my best (as you can see).

I have written clear comments on each line that you dont know (possibly every line ðŸ’€) so read it (I didn't waste 10 hours just to get ignored).

## Up Next in this series is.........

Commisioning with api (someone do some pr or something i am tired)

## Ignition â›½

I used mvd (matter virtual device) by Google to make a virtual light bulb so I can play with it. \
Link : https://developers.home.google.com/matter/tools/virtual-device \
Go download, _Not for broke people using windows I guess_, Instead of using pirated windows shit just use linux or something man.

So then the usual \
`npm install` \
`node app.js`

Then App runs and so many matter logs will appear dont worry I dont even know what all that is but it works.
